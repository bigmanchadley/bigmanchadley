## Hi, I'm John Heid ðŸ‘‹
 ðŸš— Iâ€™m currently working on a racing/drifting game in Godot!
 
I've been into programming ever since my first project, a Haxball clone in Unity. I largely took a break from game/dev during college, but have been recently getting back into it with the Godot Engine. Physics based movement (Lonely Mountain Downhill) and system management/optimization (Factorio), or both combined (Cosmoteer) are my biggest inspirations.

While my main hobby is game development, I enjoy programming as a whole! Especially interested in back-end! I'm in the early days of my career, but I'd love to eventually work at a startup with a smaller team, an environment where you get to wear multiple hats and are working closely with others!

My goals this year:
ðŸ’¼Get some job experience!
- Finish a vertical-slice of my game, Flick!
- Participate in a game jam!
