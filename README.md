## Hi, I'm John Heid 👋
 🚗 I’m currently working on a racing/drifting game in Godot!
 
I've been into programming ever since my first project, a Haxball clone in Unity. I largely took a break from game development during college, but have been recently getting back into it with the Godot Engine. While my main hobby is game development, I'm currently on the lookout for a back-end or software role, ideally writing Python, C++, or Go. If you're hiring, let me know!

Goals this year:

⚙️Finish a vertical-slice of my game, Flick

🔥Participate in Ludum Dare
