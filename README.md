## Hi, I'm John Heid ðŸ‘‹
 ðŸš— Iâ€™m currently working on a racing/drifting game in Godot!
 
I've been into programming ever since my first project, a Haxball clone in Unity. I largely took a break from game/dev during college, but have been recently getting back into it with the Godot Engine. Physics based movement (Lonely Mountain Downhill) and system management/optimization (Factorio), or both combined (Cosmoteer) are my biggest inspirations.

While my main hobby is game development, I enjoy programming as a whole! Especially back-end!
