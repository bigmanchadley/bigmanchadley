## Hi, I'm John Heid 👋
 🚗 I’m currently working on a racing/drifting game in Godot!
 
I've been into programming ever since my first project, a Haxball clone in Unity. I largely took a break from game/dev during college, but have been recently getting back into it with the Godot Engine.

While my main hobby is game development, I enjoy programming as a whole, especially back-end! 

Goals this year:

💼Get some job experience!

⚙️Finish a vertical-slice of my game, Flick!

🔥Participate in Ludum Dare!
